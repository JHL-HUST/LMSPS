## News

* **2024-09:** LMSPS is accepted by **NeurIPS 2024**.
* **2024-02:** [Rank 1](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_nodeprop/#ogbn-mag) on OGBN-MAG Leaderboard.

## Requirements

All experiments are conducted on Tesla V100 GPU (16GB).

Please install the requirements using the following command. (The python version is 3.9.18)

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/Yangxc13/sparse_tools.git --depth=1
cd sparse_tools
python setup.py develop
cd ..
```

## Data preparation

For HGB datasets:

```
sh download_hgb_datasets.sh
```

For experiments on the large dataset ogbn-mag, the dataset will be automatically downloaded from OGB challenge.

## Run LMSPS

You can run LMSPS on HGB and ogbn-mag based on the command in [hgb](https://github.com/JHL-HUST/LMSPS/tree/main/hgb) and [ogbn-mag](https://github.com/JHL-HUST/LMSPS/tree/main/ogbn), respectively.
